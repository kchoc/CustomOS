Stability:
 - Currently not race safe for SMP especially in VFS
 - Potential memory leaks in file descriptor management
 - Limited system call error handling leading to undefined behavior in edge cases

Security
 - Possilibty of user program allocating Virtual memory pages that overlap with kernel memory pages leading to privilege escalation. (this might not actually be occuring since I preallocate kernel pages at boot time but needs to be verified)
